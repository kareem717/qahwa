- Always use the base component props when creating a NON-PAGE (i.e. not a  `function HomePage()`) component via `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` or the like. 
- ALWAYS use `function` instead of a arrow function, unless it is not possible due to the ts-compiler.
- Always allow for the `className` prop to be passed and use `cn` from `@qahwa/ui/lib/utils` to merge the classes.
- Always import individually from React, instead of using `import React from 'react'`.
- Use component co-location if the compnent being implemented is only used within that directory/route - otherwise put it in the shared, respective, `components` foler.
